# trialLoops

In this problem set, you will build a short experiment containing at least oone trial loop (min 3 trials). Ideally, these trials should involve stimuli that you might use in your research. Practically, they can also just involve a simple event (e.g. presenting different text on each trial). Responses aren't required but would be good practice. Output also isn't required but would be good practice. Basically, you can make this as complex or simple as you like!

To help break up the tasks, we've provided three template scripts:

Step 1: helps you make one trial. This could be range from presenting text to the screen to presenting multiple stimuli at different times (relative to a trialClock) and recording responses. I recommend playing with the CoderIngredients tutorial script for inspiration!

Step 2: helps you turn it into a loop which iterates over at least 3 trials


This is an individual assignment but you are encouraged to get help from and to help others in the class.

Good luck and be sure to reach out for help if you get stuck.
